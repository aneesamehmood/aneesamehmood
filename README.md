# Hi there! ðŸ¤—

I'm Aneesa, a software engineer undergrad student in VA.

I love mixing my tech skills with design to make cool and efficient apps, aiming to build software that's scalable and super user-friendly. Outside of work, I'm always learning more about tech, juggling side projects, diving into full stack development, and balancing my coursework. I'm passionate about art and gaming, and I hope to make my own games someday. I'm still figuring out my true passion, but I'm excited about the journey and where it will take me.

Fun Facts:
  - I really like matcha.
  - Zombie apocalypse story games are my favorite.
  - Most of my money goes to Lego sets.
